Statically linked libraries are linked in at compile time. 
Dynamically linked libraries are loaded at run time. Static linking bakes the l
ibrary bit into your executable. Dynamic linking only bakes in a reference to the library.
the bits for the dynamic library exist elsewhere and could be swapped out later.
